FEATURE
* [ ] Refactor: Upgrade Vue 2 -> Vue 3
* [x] Filter: Filter should highlight instead of actually filtering
* [x] GRAPH - Highlight: shift click to add to highlights

BUGS
* [x] Graph Pane (Highlight) - enlargement is only working sometimes during 'click to highlight from node details' - not during click on graph pane
* [ ] Graph Pane (Reordering) - Dragging a node, all the connected nodes follow. We want to drag it away and not have them follow so aggresively  (Only happens with few nodes)
* [ ] Graph Pane (Highlight) - node detail labels do not follow dragged node
