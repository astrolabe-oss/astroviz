# BUGS
* [ ] App View: highlighting broken
* [x] Graph Pane (Highlight) - enlargement is only working sometimes during 'click to highlight from node details' - not during click on graph pane
* [x] Graph Pane (Highlight) - node detail labels do not follow dragged node
* [ ] Graph Pane (Reordering) - Dragging a node, all the connected nodes follow. We want to drag it away and not have them follow so aggresively  (Only happens with few nodes)
